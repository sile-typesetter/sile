    SILE is a typesetting system; its job is to produce beautiful printed
    documents. Conceptually, SILE is similar to TeX—from which it borrows
    some concepts and even syntax and algorithms—but the similarities end
    there. Rather than being a derivative of the TeX family SILE is a new
    typesetting and layout engine written from the ground up using modern
    technologies and borrowing some ideas from graphical systems such as
    InDesign.]],
