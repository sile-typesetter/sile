    The moonlight bathes the silent trees,  
    With silver breath upon the leaves.  
    A hush descends across the land,  
    As night slips gently from its hand.

    No hurried feet, no call, no cry,  
    Just quiet stars up in the sky.  
    Beneath their watch, the world is still,  
    Enchanted by the moonâ€™s own will.
