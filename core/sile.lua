--- The wild-west of stash stuff.
-- No rules, just right (or usually wrong). Everything in here *should* be somewhere else, but lots of early SILE code
-- relied on this as a global key/value store for various class, document, and package values. Since v0.14.0 with many
-- core SILE components being instances of classes –and especially with each package having it's own variable namespace–
-- there are almost always better places for things. This scratch space will eventually be completely deprecated, so
-- don't put anything new in here and only use things in it if there are no other current alternatives.

-- @table documentState
-- @tfield table documentClass The instantiated document processing class.
-- @tfield table thisPageTemplate The frameset used for the current page (deprecated).

--- User input
-- @section input

--- All user-provided input collected before beginning document processing.
-- User input values, currently from CLI options, potentially all the inuts
-- needed for a user to use a SILE-as-a-library version to produce documents
-- programmatically.
-- @table input
-- @tfield table filenames Path names of file(s) intended for processing. Files are processed in the order provided.
-- File types may be mixed of any formaat for which SILE has an inputter module.
-- @tfield table evaluates List of strings to be evaluated as Lua code snippets *before* processing inputs.
-- @tfield table evaluateAfters List of strings to be evaluated as Lua code snippets *after* processing inputs.
-- @tfield table uses List of strings specifying module names (and optionally optionns) for modules to load *before*
-- processing inputs. For example this accommodates loading inputter modules before any input of that type is encountered.
-- Additionally it can be used to process a document using a document class *other than* the one specified in the
-- document itself. Document class modules loaded here are instantiated after load, meaning the document will not be
-- queried for a class at all.
-- @tfield table options Extra document class options to set or override in addition to ones found in the first input
-- document.

--- Initialize a SILE instance.
-- Presumes CLI args have already been processed and/or library inputs are set.
--
-- 1. If no backend has been loaded already (e.g. via `--use`) then assumes *libtexpdf*.
-- 2. Loads and instantiates a shaper and outputter module appropriate for the chosen backend.
-- 3. Starts a Lua profiler if the profile debug flag is set.
-- 4. Instantiates a dependency tracker if we've been asked to write make dependencies.
-- 5. Runs any code snippents passed with `--eval`.
--
-- Does not move on to processing input document(s).

-- Module types supported bay be an *inputter*, *outputer*, *shaper*, *typesetter*, *pagebuilder*, or *package*.
-- @tparam string|table module The module spec name to load (dot-separated, e.g. `"packages.lorem"`) or a table with
--   a module that has already been loaded.
-- @tparam[opt] table options Startup options as key/value pairs passed to the module when initialized.

--- Process an input string.
-- First converts the string to an AST, then runs `process` on it.

--- Finalize document processing
-- Signals that all the `SILE.process()` calls have been made and SILE should move on to finish up the output
--
-- 1. Tells the document class to run its `:finish()` method. This method is typically responsible for calling the
-- `:finish()` method of the outputter module in the appropriate sequence.
-- 2. Closes out anything in active memory we don't need like font instances.
-- 3. Evaluate any snippets in SILE.input.evalAfter table.
-- 4. Stops logging dependencies and writes them to a makedepends file if requested.
-- 5. Close out the Lua profiler if it was running.
-- 6. Output version information if versions debug flag is set.
