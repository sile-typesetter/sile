   detailed = [[SILE is a typesetting system; its job is to produce beautiful printed documents.
      Conceptually, SILE is similar to TeX—from which it borrows some concepts and even
      syntax and algorithms—but the similarities end there. Rather than being a
      derivative of the TeX family SILE is a new typesetting and layout engine written
      from the ground up using modern technologies and borrowing some ideas from
      graphical systems such as InDesign.]],
