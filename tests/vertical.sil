% Note: differences between Noto font versions make adding more characters to
% this test brittle. For examle 日本は昔からruns into trouble when the height
% of 昔 is different. If the tate layout mechanism is working, it’s going
% to work at two characters, if a longer string fails, it’s likely some other
% mechanism or value that actually changed.
