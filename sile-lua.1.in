.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @TRANSFORMED_PACKAGE_NAME@
.B [\fIoptions\fR]
.B [\fIINPUT\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The SILE Typesetter reads input file(s) and typesets the content into a rendered document format, typically PDF.
.LP
By default, input files may be in declarative SIL markup, structured XML, or programmatic Lua.
The input format is automatically detected by the active modules.
By default, the output will be a file with the same name as the first input file with the extension changed to .pdf.
The output filename can be overridden with the \fB\-\-output\fR argument.
Using \fB\-\-backend\fR one can change to a different output format (or a different driver for the same format).
Additional input or output formats can be handled by loading a 3rd party module that supports them by adding \fB\-\-use\fR argument on the command line (which will load prior to attempting to read input documents).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-backend= \fIvalue\fR
Specify the output backend.
.IP
The default is \fIlibtexpdf\fR and suitible for most PDF output.
Alternatives supported out of the box include \fItext\fR, \fIdebug\fR, \fIdummy\fR, \fIcairo\fR, and \fIpodofo\fR.
Other outputters may be enabled via \fI--use\fR.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-class= \fIvalue\fR
Override the default or specified document class.
.IP
The default class for documents that do not specify one in the root tag is \fIplain\fR.
This can be used to either change the default class or to override the class actually specified in a document.
Other bundled classes include \fIbase\fR, \fIbible\fR, \fIbook\fR, \fIdiglot\fR, \fIdocbook\fR, \fIdocbook\fR, \fIjbook\fR, \fIjplain\fR, \fIletter\fR, \fIpecha\fR, \fItbook\fR, \fItplain\fR, and \fItriglot\fR.
Others will be loaded dynamically from the module path.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-debug= \fIvalue\fR[,\fIvalue\fR]
Show debug information for tagged aspects of SILE’s operation.
.IP
Multiple debug flags may be given as a comma separated list.
While packages may define their own debug flags, the most commonly used ones are \fItypesetter\fR, \fIpagebuilder\fR, \fIvboxes\fR, \fIbreak\fR, \fIframes\fR, \fIprofile\fR, and \fIversions\fR.
May be specified more than once.
.TP
.BR \-e ", " \-\-evaluate= \fIvalue\fR
Evaluate Lua expression before processing input.
.IP
May be specified more than once.
.TP
.BR \-E ", " \-\-evaluate-after= \fIvalue\fR
Evaluate Lua expression after processing input.
.IP
May be specified more than once.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-fontmanager= \fIvalue\fR
Specify which font manager to use.
.IP
The font manager is responsible for discovering the locations on font files on the system given a font name.
The default font manager is \fIfontconfig\fR on non-macOS systems and \fImacfonts\fR on macOS.
.TP
.BR \-m ", " \-\-makedeps \fIfile\fR
Generate a list of dependencies in Makefile format.
.IP
This tracks all the files (input files, Lua libraries, fonts, images, etc.) use during the typesetting process.
After completion, the list is written to FILE in the format of a dependency list for a target in a Makefile.
This can be used later to determine if a PDF needs re-rendering based on whether any inputs have changed.
.TP
.BR \-o ", " \-\-output= \fIfile\fR
Explicitly set the output file name.
.IP
By default the basename of the first input file will be used as the output filename.
An extension will be chosen based on the output backend, typically .pdf.
With this option any arbitrary name and path can be given.
Additionally \fI-\fR can be used to write the output to STDOUT.
.TP
.BR \-O ", " \-\-options= \fIparameter=value\fR[,\fIparameter=value\fR]
Set or override document class options.
.IP
Can be used to change default options or override the ones specified in a document.
For example setting \fB\-\-options papersize=letter\fR would override both the default \fIpapersize\fR of A4 and any specific one set in the document’s options.
May be specified more than once.
.TP
.BR \-I ", " \-\-include= \fIfilename\fR
Deprecated, use \-\-use, \-\-preamble, \-\-postamble, or multiple input files.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-preamble= \fIfilename\fR
Include the contents of a SIL, XML, or other resource file before the input document content.
.IP
The value should be a full filename with a path relative to PWD or an absolute path.
May be specified more than once.
.TP
.BR \-P ", " \-\-postamble= \fIfilename\fR
Include the contents of a SIL, XML, or other resource file after the input document content.
.IP
The value should be a full filename with a path relative to PWD or an absolute path.
May be specified more than once.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-use= \fImodule\fR [[\fIparameter=value[,parameter=value]]]\fR
Load and initialize a class, inputter, shaper, or other module before processing the main input.
.IP
The value should be a loadable module name (with no extension, using \fI'.'\fR as a path separator) and will be loaded using SILE’s module search path.
Options may be passed to the module by enclosing \fIkey=value\fR pairs in square brackets following the module name.
This is particularly useful when the input document is not SIL or a natively recognized XML scheme and SILE needs to be taught new tricks before even trying to read the input file.
If the module is a document class, it will replace \fIplain\fR as the default class for processing documents that do not specifically identify one to use.
Because this executes before loading the document, it may even add an input parser or modify an existing one to support new file formats.
Package modules will be added to the preamble to be loaded after the class is initialized.
May be specified more than once.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
Suppress warnings and informational messages during processing.
.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-traceback
Display detailed location trace on errors and warnings.
.TP
.BR [INPUT]
Input document filename(s), by default in SIL, XML, or Lua formats.
.IP
One or more input files from which to process content.
The first listed file is considered the master document, others are procced in sequence.
Other inputter formats may be enabled via \fI--use\fR.
Use \fI-\fR to read a content stream from STDIN.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Print version.
