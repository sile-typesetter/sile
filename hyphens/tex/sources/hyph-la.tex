% ==========================================
% Patterns for the latin language mainly in modern spelling
% (u when u is needed and v when v is needed); medieval spelling
% with the ligatures æ and œ and the (uncial) lowercase ‘v’
% written as a ‘u’ is also supported; apparently there is no conflict
% between the patterns of modern  Latin and those of medieval Latin.
%
% For more information please read the babel-latin documentation.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%  For documentation see:
%  C. Beccari, “Computer aided hyphenation for Italian and Modern
%        Latin”, TUG vol. 13, n. 1, pp. 23-33 (1992)
%
%  see also
%
%  C. Beccari, “Typesetting of ancient languages”,
%              TUG vol.15, n.1, pp. 9-16 (1994)
%
%  In the former paper  the  code  was  described  as  being contained in file
%  ITALAT.TEX; this is substantially the same code,  but  the  file  has  been
%  renamed and included in hyph-utf8.
%
%  A corresponding file (ITHYPH.TEX) has been extracted in order to  eliminate
%  the  (few)  patterns specific to Latin and leave those specific to Italian;
%  ITHYPH.TEX has been further  extended  with  many  new patterns in order to
%  cope with the many neologisms and technical terms with foreign roots.
%
%  Should you find any word that gets hyphenated in a wrong way, please, AFTER
%  CHECKING  ON A RELIABLE MODERN DICTIONARY, report to the author, preferably
%  by e-mail.  Please  do  not  report  about  wrong  break  points concerning
%  prefixes and/or suffixes; see at the bottom of this file.
%
%  Compared with the previous versions, this file has been extended so  as  to
%  cope also with the medieval Latin spelling, where the letter ‘V’ played the
%  roles of both ‘U’ and ‘V’, as in the Roman times, save that the Romans used
%  only capitals. In the middle ages the availability of soft writing supports
%  and the necessity of copying books with a reasonable speed, several scripts
%  evolved  in  (practically)  all  of  which  there was a lower case alphabet
%  different from the upper case  one,  and  where  the lower case ‘v’ had the
%  rounded shape of our modern lower case ‘u’, and where the Latin  diphthongs
%  ‘Æ’  and  ‘Œ’,  both  in  upper and lower case, where written as ligatures,
%  not to mention the habit of  substituting  them with their sound, that is a
%  simple ‘E'.
%
%  According  to  Leon  Battista  Alberti,  who  in  1466  wrote  a  book   on
%  cryptography  where  he  thoroughly  analyzed  the hyphenation of the Latin
%  language of his (still  medieval)  times,  the  differences from the Tuscan
%  language (the Italian language, as it was named  at  his  time)  were  very
%  limited,  in particular for what concerns the handling of the ascending and
%  descending diphthongs; in  Central  and  Northern  Europe,  and later on in
%  North America, the Scholars perceived the above diphthongs as made  of  two
%  distinct  vowels;  the  hyphenation of medieval Latin, therefore, was quite
%  different in the northern countries compared to the southern ones, at least
%  for what concerns these  diphthongs.  If  you need hyphenation patterns for
%  medieval Latin that suite you better according to the  habits  of  Northern
%  Europe  you  should  resort  to the hyphenation patterns prepared by Yannis
%  Haralambous (TUGboat, vol.13 n.4 (1992)).
%
%
%
%                            PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES
%
% For what concerns prefixes and suffixes, the latter are generally  separated
% according  to  “natural”  syllabification,  while  the  former are generally
% divided etimologically. In order to  avoid  an excessive number of patterns,
% care has been paid to some prefixes,  especially  “ex”,  “trans”,  “circum”,
% “prae”,  but  this set of patterns is NOT capable of separating the prefixes
% in all circumstances.
%
%                         BABEL SHORTCUTS AND FACILITIES
%
% Read  the  documentation  coming  with the discription of the Latin language
% interface of  Babel  in  order  to  see  the  shortcuts  and  the facilities
% introduced in order to facilitate the insertion  of  “compound  word  marks”
% which are very useful for inserting etymological break points.
%
% Happy Latin and multilingual typesetting!
