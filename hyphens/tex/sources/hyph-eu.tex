%         February 1997 Patterns created by Juan M. Aguirregabiria, based on the
%         shyphen.sh script for Spanish by Julio Sanchez, September 1991.

%         26 June 2008 Generating script rewritten in Ruby and adapted for native
%         UTF-8 TeX engines, patterns renamed from bahyph.tex to
%         hyph-eu.tex and added to the hyph-utf8 package.  Functionality should
%         not change apart from adding ñ by default.
